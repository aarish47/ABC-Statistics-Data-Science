Surrogate endpoints in medical research are like stand-ins or substitutes for the main things we're interested in. Instead of waiting a long time to see if a treatment really works, we use these easier-to-measure markers that might give us a clue.

But, it's important to check if these markers actually tell us what we really want to know about a patient's health.

> # **Is it necessary to use Surrogate end-points??**

Yes, surrogate endpoints can play an important role in the initial process of developing new drugs or treatments in dentistry, as they can provide a faster and more cost-effective way to evaluate the **potential efficacy** of a new intervention. 

> # **Is relying on surrogate endpoints risky?**

Careful use of surrogate endpoints is advised, as they can provide ambiguous evidence and may not be extrapolated to other populations.

Additionally, **the use of unplanned surrogate outcomes that arise during the study requires a lot of caution**. It is important to validate substitute parameters for clinical studies and consider the advantages and disadvantages of using surrogate endpoints.

They are not **inherently dangerous**, but the risk arises if they are used without proper validation.

> # **An easy yet understandable example!**

A notable example of surrogate endpoints is found in **cardiovascular research.**

Instead of waiting for actual heart events (like cardiac arrest) which can take a long time to occur, researchers may use surrogate markers like cholesterol levels or blood pressure to predict the effectiveness of a treatment in preventing future cardiovascular events.

These surrogate endpoints offer quicker insights into the potential success of a treatment without having to wait for long-term outcomes.
