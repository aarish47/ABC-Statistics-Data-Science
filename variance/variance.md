In statistics, variance is a measure of the dispersion or spread of a set of data points in a dataset. It quantifies how much each data point in the set differs from the mean (average) of the entire dataset. 

A high variance indicates that the values in the dataset are spread out over a wider range, while a low variance suggests that the values are closer to the mean.

## **Formula**

The variance (\(S^2\) or \(\sigma^2\)) is calculated using the following formula:

\[ S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} \]

Where:
- \(S^2\) is the sample variance.
- \(n\) is the number of data points in the sample.
- \(x_i\) is each individual data point.
- \(\bar{x}\) is the mean of the dataset.

## **Interpretation**

- **Large Variance**: Indicates a wide dispersion of values from the mean, suggesting greater variability in the dataset.
- **Small Variance**: Suggests that the data points are closer to the mean, indicating less variability.

## **Example**

Consider the dataset: 4, 7, 9, 11, 13.

1. Calculate the mean: \(\bar{x} = \frac{4 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13}{5} = 8.8\).
2. Calculate the squared differences from the mean: \((4-8.8)^2, (7-8.8)^2, (9-8.8)^2, (11-8.8)^2, (13-8.8)^2\).
3. Sum the squared differences: \(70.8\).
4. Calculate the variance: \(S^2 = \frac{70.8}{5-1} = 17.7\).

In this example, the variance is 17.7, indicating the degree of dispersion of the data points from the mean.
