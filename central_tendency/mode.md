> # **Mode**

Imagine walking into a room and noticing that most people are wearing blue. In that room, blue is the mode â€“ the most frequently occurring value. In statistics, the mode refers to the value or values that appear most often in a dataset. It is the crowd favorite, the trendsetter of the data world.

> # **Example of Mode**

Let's say you have the following set of numbers representing the number of books different students read in a month:

{5,3,7,3,2,5,8,5,2,3}

In this case, the mode is 5 because it appears more frequently than any other number in the set. So, the mode of this dataset is 5. If no number repeated more than once, the dataset would be said to have no mode.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set. In the given example, the number "5" appears twice which is more than any other number so it can be said to be the mode of this dataset. The mode helps us to understand what number dominates or frequently occurs in a dataset.
