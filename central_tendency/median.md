> # **Median**

A median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample. It is used to find the middle number(s) when the data are ordered. In case of an odd-numbered list, the median is the middle number. 

If the list has an even number of observations, then the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The concept
of median can be extended for multi-component data sets as well where we calculate
the medians separately for each component and then combine them.

This property makes it suitable for multivariate analysis.


> # **Example of Median**

A group of students are given marks out of 85. They scored the following marks : [73, 69, 78, 82, 76], the median is the middle value if the list of numbers were sorted in ascending order. If we sort it then the median will be (76+78)/2 = 76.


> # **How to calculate the Median**

**Order Your Data:** Line up all your numbers from the smallest to the largest.

**Find the Middle:** If you have an odd number of values, the median is the one right in the middle. With an even number, it’s the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, in the data set [3, 5, 7, 9, 11], the median is 7. But for [3, 5, 7, 9], it’s (5 + 7) / 2, which is 6.
