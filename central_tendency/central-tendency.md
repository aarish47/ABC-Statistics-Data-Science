> # **What is Central Tendency**

Central tendency is about finding the middle or most common value in a group of numbers.

It’s the point around which the data clusters. Think of it as a way to summarize a whole lot of numbers with just one value that represents them best.

> # **The three factors**

1. Median
2. Mode
3. Mean(Average)

> # **Median**

Line up all the values and pick the one in the middle. Imagine standing in a queue and finding the person right in the center.

The median is the number that separates the higher half from the lower half of a data sample.

> # **Mode**

This is the number that shows up the most in the group. Sometimes there's no mode, sometimes there's one, and sometimes there's more than one.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set of data.

If more than one number has the highest frequency, then all will be considered as modes. The mode can not be negative and must be greater than zero.

> # **Mean(Average)**

Adds up all the values and divide by the number of values. It’s like sharing a cake equally among friends. It represents the typical amount or level of a variable in a dataset.

The mean can also represent the average score obtained by students in a class. In general, the mean is used to find out what value you should aim for when achieving success or happiness etc.
