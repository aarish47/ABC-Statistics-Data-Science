> # **Measurement Bias, What is it?**

Biasness is basically any factor that causes a systematic distortion in data collection. In simpler words, Bias refers to anything that makes the way we gather information unfair.

Like for example, when a survey about a new product is only given to people who already like the company, so the results may not represent the opinions of a broader audience.

We should always try to remove biasness from our data, its really important to do so.

> # **Why should we remove Biasness from Data?**

Bias can distort the accuracy and fairness of our information, leading to unreliable results and skewed perspectives. 

Removing bias helps ensure that data reflects a more truthful and representative picture, which is crucial for making informed decisions and fostering equal opportunities.

Removing biasness is really crucial because it ensures fairness and accuracy in our data. Bias can distort information, leading to skewed perspectives and unfair outcomes. 

> # **What advantages will we gain if we remove Bias from our data?**

1. Improved accuracy of statistical tests (Statistical Power)
2. Increased confidence in the results obtained
3. Reduction in Type I errors (False Positives)
4. Efficiency in constructing models
5. Better generalization of machine learning algorithms
6. More robustness against overfitting
7. Enhanced interpretability of results
8. Facilitation of hypothesis testing
9. Simplification of model selection procedures
10. fosters an environment that encourages innovation

> # **Factors that Biasness affects**

There are mainly two factors that bias does affect, below are the two factors;

1. Data Accuracy
2. Reliabillity of Results

The first factor relates to how accurately our measurements reflect the underlying reality. Data Accuracy refers to how closely observed data matches reality. 

On the other hand, reliabilty of results refers to how well a method can predict future observations based on past data. 

If you have high reliability but low accuracy then your predictions might be very good but they won't necessarily reflect what is actually happening in the real world. This is known
as Spurious Correlation. 

Conversely, if you have high accuracy but low reliability then even though your predictions may not be correct they could still represent what is happenning in the real world. This is known as False Positive Error.

> # **The different types of Bias**

1. Sampling Bias
2. Selection Bias
3. Confirmation Bias
4. Survivalship Bias
5. Reporting Bias
6. Information Bias

> # **How do these Bias occur**

1. Sampling bias occurs when a sample is not a representative of a Population.

2. Selection bias happens when the process of selecting participants or data points effect the study outcome.

3. Confirmation bias is when people pay more attention to things that agree with what they already think. They might ignore or forget things that don't agree with their ideas. It's like only listening to what you want to hear.

4. Survivorship bias means focusing only on the things or people that have survived or succeeded, ignoring the ones that didn't. It's like looking at the winners and forgetting about those who didn't make it.

5. Reporting bias is when the information we get is not complete or fair because some details are left out. It's like telling a story but only sharing certain parts, making it not entirely accurate or unbiased.

6. Information bias is when the information we have is not quite right or accurate. It's like having some puzzle pieces missing, so we don't get the whole picture. This can happen when data is not collected or interpreted properly, leading to a distorted view of the situation.

> # **How to remove biasness?**

**Be Aware:** Recognize and acknowledge that bias can exist in various forms, both consciously and unconsciously.

**Educate Yourself:** Learn about different perspectives and experiences to broaden your understanding and reduce personal biases.

**Question Assumptions:** Challenge your assumptions and question the information you receive. Be open to different viewpoints.

**Diverse Perspectives:** Seek out diverse perspectives and opinions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a topic.

**Critical Thinking:** Develop critical thinking skills to analyze information objectively and avoid jumping to conclusions.
