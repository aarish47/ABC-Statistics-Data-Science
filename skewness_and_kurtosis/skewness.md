Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of a probability distribution. It quantifies the extent and direction of skew (departure from horizontal symmetry) in the data.

## **Understanding Skewness**

Skewness indicates whether the data points in a distribution are concentrated more on one side than the other. There are two main types of skewness: positive (right-skewed) and negative (left-skewed).

- **Positive Skewness (Right-skewed):** In a positively skewed distribution, the tail on the right-hand side is longer or fatter than the left-hand side. This implies that there are more extreme values on the right, and the distribution is stretched in that direction.

- **Negative Skewness (Left-skewed):** In a negatively skewed distribution, the tail on the left-hand side is longer or fatter than the right-hand side. This suggests that there are more extreme values on the left, and the distribution is stretched in that direction.

## **Formula for Skewness**

The sample skewness is often calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Skewness} = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s} \right)^3 \]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of data points in the sample.
- \( x_i \) represents each data point.
- \( \bar{x} \) is the sample mean.
- \( s \) is the sample standard deviation.

## **Interpretation of Skewness**

1. **Skewness = 0:** A skewness of 0 indicates a perfectly symmetrical distribution.

2. **Skewness > 0:** A positive skewness indicates a distribution with a tail on the right and is often referred to as right-skewed. The mean is typically greater than the median.

3. **Skewness < 0:** A negative skewness indicates a distribution with a tail on the left and is often referred to as left-skewed. The mean is typically less than the median.
